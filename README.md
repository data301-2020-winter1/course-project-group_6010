This dataset shows video game sales with ratings. The dataset is merged by two data provided by VGChartz and Metacritic. It has a game name, console on which the game is running, the year of the game released, genre, publisher, and game sales in North America, European Union, Japan and the rest of countries, total sales in the world. It also contains critic score (aggregate score compiled by Metacritic staff), critic count (the number of critics used in coming up with the Criticscore), user score ( score by Metacritic's subscribers ), user count (number of users who gave the userscore), developer (party responsible for creating the game), and rating from ESRB ratings. This dataset was created in 2016. The purpose of this dataset is to see machine learning techniques and visualize the continued data. The data was generated by web scrapes.
